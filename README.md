# Big-Data-Analysis-and-Project
Big Data Analysis and Project exploring crime patterns in South Australia (2023–24) and their link to socioeconomic disadvantage (SEIFA 2021). Includes cleaned datasets, exploratory analysis, visualisations, and predictive modelling with Ridge and Logistic Regression.

This repository contains the replication package for the Big Data Analysis project. The project investigates crime patterns in South Australia (2023–24) and their relationship with socioeconomic disadvantage (SEIFA 2021).

Repository Contents

Datasets

Private Rental Reports (Raw) – unmodified SA Gov datasets.

Filtered Datasets – cleaned datasets used for model training and evaluation.

Notebooks

Pre-processing, visualisation, and modelling notebooks. These were developed and executed entirely in Google Colab/local environment.

All code cells are pre-run and outputs are saved in the notebooks.

Reports

Assignment submissions (1A, 1B, 1C, and final report).

How to Run

No additional setup is required.

Open the notebooks directly in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

All outputs are already included, so re-running is optional.

Results

Ridge Regression: R² = 1.000, MAE = 0.02, RMSE = 0.10

Logistic Regression: Accuracy = 0.94, F1 = 0.95

Figures include offence concentration plots, SEIFA–crime correlations, and confusion matrix.
